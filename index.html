  <h1>To what extent was fear the main method used by the Nazis to control the German people? </h1>
  <p>My name is agent 2735. I work for the British Government. I have just received my lates mission – I must go to Frankfurt in Germany for a few weeks. I will be undercover as Hitler’s personal chef. My task is to discover exactly how the leader of Germany, Adolf Hitler, is controlling the German people. 
  <br><br>
  The British Government already know that he uses fear tactics, but I will need to find out more about what exactly he is doing or saying that scares people. 
  <br><br>
  We know that he has other tactics too – like propaganda and censorship so I will investigate these while I am there. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Day 1: Thursday 5 September 1935 </h2>
  <p1>I arrived yesterday in Frankfurt and the other chef, called Barry, showed me where I will be working and where I will be sleeping. All the rooms for servants are much nicer than I expected, and I had an incredibly good night's sleep last night. When we were walking to the kitchens, I noticed that they were right next to Hitler’s meeting room, so I will be able to hear everything that he says to people such as Heinrich Himmler (the leader of the SS) and other important people. When Barry was showing me around, he seemed very happy, and it was not at all like Hitler was using fear on German people. I did notice that he would not stop talking about how great Germany is and how much better Hitler has made it, so I will see if all German people have been brainwashed to think like this. </p1>
  <br>
  <h3>Day 2: Friday 6 September 1935 </h3>
  <p2>Today I was able to find out a lot more about the way the Germans are being controlled. The chefs only have to work in the morning and evening so in the break I was able to go out in the streets and find out more. The first thing I noticed is that there are posters everywhere. They all seem to be about how great Germany is and how they are superior to all other countries. I will include one at the end of this document. I think that this could be one way that Hitler could be controlling the Germans and that along with other propaganda could be part of how Germans like Barry are being controlled. On my walk I was asking the people some questions and I met someone who said it was not safe to be talking about that kind of thing in the street and invited me to his house. I knew that it was risky, but it is such a good opportunity to get information that I had to take the risk of being reported. </p2>
