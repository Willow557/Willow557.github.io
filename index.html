  <h1>To what extent was fear the main method used by the Nazis to control the German people? </h1>
  <p>My name is agent 2735. I work for the British Government. I have just received my lates mission – I must go to Frankfurt in Germany for a few weeks. I will be undercover as Hitler’s personal chef. My task is to discover exactly how the leader of Germany, Adolf Hitler, is controlling the German people. 
  <br><br>
  The British Government already know that he uses fear tactics, but I will need to find out more about what exactly he is doing or saying that scares people. 
  <br><br>
  We know that he has other tactics too – like propaganda and censorship so I will investigate these while I am there. </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Day 1: Thursday 5 September 1935 </h2>
  <p1>I arrived yesterday in Frankfurt and the other chef, called Barry, showed me where I will be working and where I will be sleeping. All the rooms for servants are much nicer than I expected, and I had an incredibly good night's sleep last night. When we were walking to the kitchens, I noticed that they were right next to Hitler’s meeting room, so I will be able to hear everything that he says to people such as Heinrich Himmler (the leader of the SS) and other important people. When Barry was showing me around, he seemed very happy, and it was not at all like Hitler was using fear on German people. I did notice that he would not stop talking about how great Germany is and how much better Hitler has made it, so I will see if all German people have been brainwashed to think like this. </p1>
  <br>
  <h3>Day 2: Friday 6 September 1935 </h3>
  <p2>Today I was able to find out a lot more about the way the Germans are being controlled. The chefs only have to work in the morning and evening so in the break I was able to go out in the streets and find out more. The first thing I noticed is that there are posters everywhere. They all seem to be about how great Germany is and how they are superior to all other countries. I will include one at the end of this document. I think that this could be one way that Hitler could be controlling the Germans and that along with other propaganda could be part of how Germans like Barry are being controlled. On my walk I was asking the people some questions and I met someone who said it was not safe to be talking about that kind of thing in the street and invited me to his house. I knew that it was risky, but it is such a good opportunity to get information that I had to take the risk of being reported. </p2>
  <br>
  <h4>Day 3: Saturday 7 September 1935 </h4>
  <p3>On Saturdays there are different chefs that cook the food so today we had the day off. The first thing I did was go to the man I met yesterday’s house. The first thing he did when I came in was lock the door, put something in the keyhole, and unplug the telephone. Afterwards he said, “it is safe now.” I was just wondering what all the precautions were for, but he started talking. He talked about how there were Nazi spies everywhere and even though people pretended to be happy, everyone was just terrified of being put in a “concentration camp”. He said that if you said anything bad about the Nazis, then you would get taken away in the night and put in a camp for six months.  He had also heard that anyone considered an “enemy of the state” could be killed. This is a very long list of people, but just a few are Jews, Communists and pacifists. If you are secretly one of these then the fear of being found out would definitely keep you in check. When I was thanking him and leaving, he whispered in my ear that he was secretly a Jew, and he thought I was trustworthy. It definitely explained why he seemed so paranoid of someone overhearing the conversation. This is yet another example of the Nazi terror state in action. </p3>
  <br>
  <h5>Conclusion</h5>
  <p4>I think that this mission has been very successful as I have found out a lot of useful information for the government about how Hitler is controlling the people of Germany. I think that fear plays a large part in Hitler’s controlling of the German people, but propaganda and censorship definitely also play a part. Finding out about the concentration camps will also be useful because they seem to be one of the main sources of fear. </p4>
