  <h1>To what extent was fear the main method used by the Nazis to control the German people? </h1>
  <p>My name is agent 2735. I work for the British Government. I have just received my lates mission – I must go to Frankfurt in Germany for a few weeks. I will be undercover as Hitler’s personal chef. My task is to discover exactly how the leader of Germany, Adolf Hitler, is controlling the German people. 
  <br><br>
  The British Government already know that he uses fear tactics, but I will need to find out more about what exactly he is doing or saying that scares people. 
  <br><br>
  We know that he has other tactics too – like propaganda and censorship so I will investigate these while I am there. </p>
